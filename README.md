# SNPsRFImputation
Imputation of missed genotypes in GBS data using Random Forests

This repository contains supplementary material of the Maester thesis entitled: Missing genotypes imputation in next generation sequencing data. The aim of this work was to develop statistical algorithms to allow reliable predictions of missing genotypes generated with reduced representation techiniques such as GBS and ddRAD-seq.

This repository contains three files:
- processing.R: File with all comand lines used to data exploration, pre-processing and genotypes imputation
- source.R: File with designed R functions.
- source.cpp: File with designed C function.
